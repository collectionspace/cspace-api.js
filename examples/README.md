# Examples

Example scripts demonstrating the use of cspace-api for common tasks.

These examples utilize features of JavaScript [ES2015](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#readme) that are not yet supported in Node.js. To run an example script, use [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) to compile it to JavaScript ES5. The `babel-node` program from the [Babel CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/) package may be used to compile and execute a script using a single command.

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/babel-node examples/read.js
```
